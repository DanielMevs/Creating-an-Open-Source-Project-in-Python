What is Black?
PEP-8 format checker

To check if a file is PEP-8 compliant, simply
use the command:

echo $?

True means that there is something that 
needs to be reformatted and False means
that there's nothing to reformat.

Alternatively you can use the following
command to achieve the same thing:

black <filename> --check

To automatically reformat your file, simply
use the following command:

black <filename>

However, black doesn't to catch all issues.

To be thorough, use flake8

If you want to relax flake8 adherence
to PEP8, you can create a file called:

tox.ini

In the file, you can include the error
you want to be ignored:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = E501

Note: this make it no longer PEP-8 
compliant.
